<h1 id="toc_0">Beating the IQ test</h1>

<h5 id="toc_1">How to score an IQ of 130 or higher on a common IQ test.</h5>

<p>IQ tests are a highly debated topic and it is questionable wether they actually measure anything useful at all. None the less they are widely applied in situations like job interviews and aptitude tests so itâ€™s wise to have some experience with how to tackle them.</p>

<p>This article will explain how IQ tests work and teach you the basic skills you need to score an IQ of roughly 130 or higher.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">An example</h2>

<p>Most traditional IQ tests are designed around a set of puzzles of increasing difficulty where each puzzle look roughly like this:
The puzzle consists of a grid of panels where the last panel is empty. Beside this you will find another set of additional panels with suggested answers to the puzzle. Your job is to figure out which of the answers fits the solution to the puzzle.</p>

<p>The correct answer to the above puzzle is (E). To solve the puzzle you have to figure out that for each row in the puzzle the number of dots increases by one with each panel.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Terminology</h2>

<p>It helps to have a clear terminology when explaining abstract things like IQ tests. So here is a list of the different terms used in this guide:</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> A puzzle refers to one of the puzzles in an IQ test along with the set of potential answers to that puzzle. Puzzle can also be used to describe just the puzzle panels, without the answers.</p>

<p><strong>Grid:</strong> An IQ puzzle is designed around a grid structure. Most commonly a 3x3 grid as in the example above.</p>

<p><strong>Panel:</strong> A panel refers to one of the squares in the puzzle grid.</p>

<p><strong>Visual element:</strong> A Visual element is one of the shapes within the panels that make up the visual representation of the puzzle. Usually well known geometric shapes are used (lines, circles, squares, rectangles etc.). But a visual element can also be some characteristic of the shape such as the color, shade or stroke of the shape.</p>

<p><strong>Degree of freedom:</strong> A degree of freedom describes the ways in which the visual elements can transform between panels. In the example above there is one degree of freedom and that is the number of dots in each panel. Other examples of degrees of freedom of the visual elements are movement, rotation, mirror imaging, changes to color, stroke etc.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Each puzzle comes with a set of possible answers.</p>

<p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> The correct answer out of the given set of possible answers.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The solution refers to the set of rules that predict the correct answer to the puzzle. These rules are what you have to figure out in order to solve the puzzle and find the correct answer. The rules you have to figure out describes the degrees of freedom of the puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> A rule describles the behavior of a degree of freedom between panels in a strip. (For example how many degrees a visual element rotates).</p>

<p><strong>Strip:</strong> Most of the time the panels are divided into strips. Each strip gives a hint at the correct solution. In the example above each row is a strip demonstrating how one dot is added with each panel.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">The cheat sheet</h2>

<p>The key to solving a puzzle is to identify the visual elements and the degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Scan the puzzle and look at the shapes</p>

<p>Figure out what shapes are unique visual elements and which ones are repetitions of other shapes that have undergone transformation according to one of the degrees of freedom of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Once the visual elements and the degrees of freedom have been identified, figure out which answer matches the solution.</p>

<p>Things to keep in mind:</p>

<p>A puzzle can have more than one degree of freedom. For example a puzzle can contain both an arithmetic part and a logical part. Or two logical parts for that matter.</p>

<p>Sometimes some degrees of freedom or some visual elements are not relevant to the solution and can be ignored.</p>

<p>Logical degrees of freedom are the most difficult to recognize visually. So if you are stuck on a puzzle, chances are there is an XOR degree of freedom somewhere in there.</p>

<p>Sometimes strips run vertically across the grid or both horizontally and vertically.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Degrees of freedom</h2>

<p>Generally the solution questions are either arithmetical (mathematical), logical or some combination. The arithmetical and logical operations are hidden within the degrees of freedom of the puzzle. For example, a shape can be rotated 90 degrees between each panel. When first confronted with a puzzle it can be good to causally scan the puzzle to try and figure out what combination of arithmetical and logical degrees of freedom you can spot.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Arithmetical rules</h3>

<p>Arithmetical puzzles are based on one or more of the four basic arithmetical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>
<center><img src="img/arithmetical_puzzle.png" alt="Arithmetical puzzle" width="300px"></center>
<p>Addition and subtraction are the most common examples and multiplication and division are rarely used and almost never used other than multiplication by a constant, for example the number of items in a set being dubbed or halved between each panel in a series. </p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Logical rules</h3>

<center><img src="img/logical_puzzle.png" alt="Logical puzzle" width="300px"></center>

<p>Logical puzzle are based on one or more of the logical operators (AND, OR, XOR). If you are not familiar with these you can read about them on wikipedia</p>

<p>Puzzles with solutions base on XOR can be visually hard to recognize at first. In fact if you have trouble figuring out a puzzle it is a good chance the solution is based at least in part on an XOR operation.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Visual puzzles</h2>

<p>Not all puzzles are logic or arithmetic in nature. Some are based on visual pattern recognition, association and creativity. These are uncommon in more strict IQ tests so they will only be described briefly.</p>

<center><img src="img/visual_puzzle.png" alt="Visual puzzle" width="300px"></center>

<p>In visual puzzles the solution is often an overall visual theme or pattern that points to the correct answer. These are usually not based on analytical skills but instead relies more on pattern recognition or creative thinking. In my experience most serous IQ tests tend to avoid these types of puzzles as they tend to test something other than your logic deduction skills.</p>

<p>There is no clear step-by-step guide for how to solve visual puzzles as they span a much broader space than the puzzles based on arithmetic or logic. This is not necessarily that big of a problem however as they are usually trivial to solve once you realize their nature.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Beyond 130 IQ</h2>

<p>This guide will only help you to obtain an IQ score of roughly 130. Beyond that the solutions for the puzzles will start to have more than two degrees of freedom. That is exponentially more complex and it starts to be very difficult to find the solutions intuitively. This means more advanced strategies are needed to solve them efficiently. These strategies involve divide and conquer schemes to quickly reduce the solution space to a more manageable subset and is beyond the scope of this article</p>
